Hello Phu Quoc,

My name’s Jake. I’m staying here for a few weeks. I hope to stay for longer if I can set up a coding and environmental protection business. 

## Short Term Aims

I’m looking for work teaching English, teaching programming, web design, AI development, and other coding skills. I have more than 10 years experience teaching, and have worked in the service and hospitality industry. 

I can do group classes at 400,000VND per hour, for your bar, cafe or hotel. We can study hospitality English, computers, or Ukelele as you wish!

## Long Term    

I would like to set up well paid jobs collecting trash, planting trees, developing AI characters,  

Im going to approach some major financial groups in Vietnam, like Sun Group, and Vingroup. I already have some software for the project.

I hope to teach Vietnamese people how to use Github, Version Control, Codepen, Vercel, Character.ai and other sites. 

If anyone can assist with a business visa, advice, hiring, and marketing, please get in contact.
